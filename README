This repository contains code to scrape Industry Canada's Federal Corporation search tool.

https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpSrch.html

Process: We POST a search of the Corporation Number, starting at 0000001 and moving upwards. We scrape the results into a CSV file.

Bugs:
* I think non-ascii characters are not transferred correctly
